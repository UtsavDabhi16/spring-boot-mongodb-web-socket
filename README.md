# Chat Application

One On One Chat application | Spring boot & WebSocket | By Coco

## Overview


Today's focus is on real-time communication, as we build a **one-on-one chat application** that ensures private, secure conversations. Taking it a step further, we'll persist these chats in a **MongoDB database**.
